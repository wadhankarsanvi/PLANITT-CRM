## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ recommended
- npm
- PostgreSQL database
- Google Cloud OAuth credentials if using Google login or Workspace integrations

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Because this repo uses npm workspaces, installing from the root installs dependencies for `client` and `server`.

### Configure Environment

Create environment files:

```bash
server/.env
client/.env.local
```

Use the templates in [Environment Variables](#environment-variables).

### Prepare Database

From the `server` workspace:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev
```

For production-like environments:

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Run the App

Terminal 1:

```bash
npm run dev:server
```

Terminal 2:

```bash
npm run dev:client
```

Open:

```text
Frontend: http://localhost:3000
Backend:  http://localhost:5000/api
Health:   http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

## Realtime Events

The backend emits CRM-wide Socket.IO events after important changes. The frontend listens and refreshes relevant screens.

| Event | Typical trigger |
| --- | --- |
| `task:updated` | Task create/update/delete, checklist toggle, issue response. |
| `issue:updated` | Blocker reported or responded to. |
| `org:updated` | User, department, or assignment changes. |
| `project:updated` | Project or project task changes. |
| `attendance:updated` | Check-in/check-out. |
| `chat:updated` | New chat message. |

## Development Commands

Run from the repository root:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm install` | Install workspace dependencies. |
| `npm run dev` | Start the Next.js client workspace. |
| `npm run dev:client` | Start only the frontend. |
| `npm run dev:server` | Start only the backend with watch mode. |
| `npm run build` | Build the frontend. |
| `npm run start` | Start the backend server. |

Useful Prisma commands from `server/`:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev 
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma studio
```

## Troubleshooting

### `Unauthorized` or `Invalid token`

- Log in again from `/login`.
- Check that `JWT_SECRET` is stable between server restarts.
- Make sure requests include `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

### Database connection fails

- Verify `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL`.
- Confirm the database is reachable.
- Run `npx prisma generate`.
- Run migrations with `npx prisma migrate dev` or `npx prisma migrate deploy`.

### Google login does not work

- Confirm `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.
- Confirm `GOOGLE_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URI` matches the Google Cloud OAuth redirect URI.
- Confirm the Google account already exists as a CRM user.

### Google Workspace actions fail

- Connect Workspace from the dashboard first.
- Confirm the requested scopes are enabled:
  - Google Calendar events
  - Google Sheets
  - Google Drive file access
- Check that the OAuth app has the callback URL:

```text
http://localhost:5000/api/integrations/google/callback
```

### Socket updates are not visible

- Make sure the backend is running on `http://localhost:5000`.
- Make sure the frontend uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api`.
- Socket.IO currently allows `http://localhost:3000` in server CORS.

### Windows PowerShell blocks npm

If PowerShell blocks `npm`, use:

```powershell
npm.cmd run dev:client
npm.cmd run dev:server
npm.cmd run build
```

## Roadmap Ideas

- [ ] Lead and deal pipeline module
- [ ] Contact and company records
- [ ] Calendar page for CRM events
- [ ] Reports export center
 - [x] Notification inbox
- [ ] File attachments for tasks and projects
- [ ] Role/permission editor UI
 - [x] Audit log for leadership actions
- [ ] Search results page for the top search bar
- [ ] Production deployment guide


## Maintainer Notes

- Keep backend routes under `server/src/routes`.
- Keep business logic in controllers under `server/src/controllers`.
- Keep reusable frontend modules under `client/components/modules`.
- Keep app routes under `client/app`.
- Run `npm run build` before shipping frontend changes.
